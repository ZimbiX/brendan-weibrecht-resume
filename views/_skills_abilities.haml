                In my work at Allori, I have produced many software components, while maintaining Ruby idioms, conventions, and patterns. I have worked on some Rails projects, but have been mainly tasked with ones based around Sinatra and Middleman.

                I recently performed a conversion from a static website into a Sinatra application, leveraging HAML and Sass -- the result can be seen at [mosttrustedadvisers.com](http://mosttrustedadvisers.com/)

                Another recent project I've worked on is a report generator which pulls data via SurveyGizmo from a much larger application (being developed by our partner company, Beddoes Institute), for which I implemented transparent cache functionality for the large JSON datasets

                As my Object-Oriented Programming distinction project at uni, I created a version of my favourite board game, Khet ([khet.com](http://www.khet.com/)), most easily described as &lsquo;laser chess&rsquo;. The project demonstrates effective use of OO principles, and an application of the MVC design pattern. It has not yet been published publicly, but I would like to do so at some point.

                I created low-level classes for typical data structures like doubly-linked list, stack, queue, binary tree, n-ary tree; and design patterns, including the iterator.

      %strong Web development
      %ul
        %li I have worked on many websites, applying my skills in Ruby, PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; and the preprocessed derivatives HAML, Sass, and CoffeeScript
        %li I have tested and fixed countless issues with rendering sites in Internet Explorer 6-9. Recently, we've started testing using BrowserStack, which has greatly simplified the cross-browser testing process

      %strong Operating systems
      %ul
        %li I am an avid Linux user, using Ubuntu as my primary OS on my main machine from January 2013, and Zentyal (based on Ubuntu Server) on a small home server that manages cloud backup, and a large media collection
        %li I have extensive experience in popular versions of Windows, and know how to troubleshoot and fix an extensive range of issues

      %strong Communication
      %ul
        %li As a tutor for Computer Systems, I have had a key role in my lab students' learning of logic circuits and ARM assembly programming. When providing help, I have had to carefully balance the depth of my explanations to assist students' understanding, while also giving them room to learn by exploring the problems themselves.
        %li I run my own tech help business, and in providing such assistance, have been praised by many clients for my ability to readily explain complex concepts and procedures in a practical and easy to understand manner
    %li
      %strong Solving interesting problems
      %ul
        %li Friends, family, and tech help clients often come to me to help troubleshoot their computers

      %strong Attention to detail &amp; user interface design
      %ul
        %li I have an eye for usability, and as a perfectionist, I am constantly thinking about ways to improve things. I can easily spot faults and inconsistencies in design and spelling/grammar which has been of use during my testing work at Allori
    %li
      %strong Exceeding quality expectations
      %ul
        %li I am a perfectionist, so most often I will exceed task requirements in an effort to produce something impressive, such as in my weekly programming exercises at uni, or my prize-winning database program in VCE IT

    /   %strong Offering innovative ideas
    /   %ul
    /     %li I occasionally come up with innovative ideas for technologies that would improve people's lives, but lack an outlet where I can spend the time to develop these
    %li
      %strong Increasing efficiency
      %ul
        %li I am constantly improving the efficiency of my systems, such as writing macros and scripts for various tasks, or finding optimal software configurations. Linux architecture has helped greatly in this regard.

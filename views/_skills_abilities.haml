                In Melbourne's first Covid lockdown, I taught myself the pure functional frontend programming language Elm, by recreating a game I've built a few times now. PathFinder is a multiplayer maze game based on a 1974 [board game](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2884/pathfinder?) of the same name. It works well on desktop and supports multi-device or same-device multiplayer. I fell in love with Elm, and would like to write more Elm in future. >> [GitHub](https://github.com/ZimbiX/pathfinder-elm)

                I was responsible for all Forticode web and Ruby development. I built a web demonstration of Forticode's Cipherise authentication technology, and turned this into an SDK for reuse in customer applications. For deployment, I set up Passenger on AWS Red Hat, and wrote a Heroku-esque Git hook for 'git push' deployment.

            /     In my work at Allori, I produced many software components, while maintaining Ruby idioms, conventions, and patterns. I worked on some Rails projects, but was mainly tasked with ones based around Sinatra and Middleman; I would very much like to expand my Rails experience.

            /     Over the 2014â€“2015 new year I worked on an implementation of the classic box movement puzzle, [Sokoban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban). The code is reasonably well covered by minitest specs. It currently uses an ASCII command-line interface, but I also plan to create a graphical alternative. >> [GitHub](https://github.com/ZimbiX/Sokoban)

            /     At Allori, I was tasked with adding new functionality to a Rails [video course system](http://insights.connectingwithclients.com.au/); I implemented YouTube support, the ability to sync videos from more than one Vimeo account, and an improved course editing UI.

                At uni, I took the incredibly interesting concurrent programming unit, *Advanced .NET Programming* (since retitled *Concurrent Programming*). I implemented many concurrency utilities, which later allowed me to create solutions to the classical concurrency problems: Dining Philosophers, and Cigarette Smokers; and others like Hilzer's Barbershop, and River Crossing. >> [GitHub](https://github.com/ZimbiX/Concurrency)

                As my *Object-Oriented Programming* distinction project at uni, I created a version of my favourite board game, Khet ([khet.com](http://www.khet.com/)), most easily described as &lsquo;laser chess&rsquo;. The project demonstrates effective use of OO principles, and an application of the MVC design pattern. >> [GitHub](https://github.com/ZimbiX/Khet)

                In the course of taking the *Data Structures and Patterns* unit at uni, I created low-level classes for typical data structures like doubly-linked list, stack, queue, binary tree, n-ary tree; and implemented design patterns, including the iterator.

        %li As a uni tutor for Computer Systems, I had a key role in my lab students' learning of logic circuits and ARM assembly programming. When providing help, I had to carefully balance the depth of my explanations to assist students' understanding, while also giving them room to learn by exploring the problems themselves.
        %li While providing assistance through my tech help business, I have been praised by many clients for my ability to readily explain complex concepts and procedures in a practical and easy to understand manner

    /   %strong Exceeding quality expectations
    /   %ul
    /     %li I am a perfectionist, so most often I will exceed task requirements in an effort to produce something impressive, such as in my weekly programming exercises at uni, or my prize-winning database program in VCE IT

      %strong Increasing efficiency
      %ul
        %li I am consistently improving the efficiency of my systems, such as writing macros and scripts for various tasks, or finding optimal software configurations. Linux architecture has helped greatly in this regard.

        At GreenSync, having **developed and scaled deX**, a streaming event-sourced system. In my time there, deX and its ecosystem of many bridges for hardware integrations grew to be coordinating over 10,000 devices. deX was so successful that deX registration had became mandatory for all new solar system installations in SA and WA; in order for the electricity network operator to be able to throttle down solar output in rare periods of reduced network-wide demand. Building from scratch, a streaming event-sourced system, and its Que job -based bridges - and then scaling the applications and architecture - was an incredibly rewarding journey.
